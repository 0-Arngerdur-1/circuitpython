General information about the ESP8266 port
==========================================

ESP8266 is a popular WiFi-enabled System-on-Chip (SoC) by Espressif Systems.

Multitude of boards
-------------------

There are multitude of modules and boards from different sources which carry
ESP8266 chip. MicroPython tries to provide a generic port which would run on
as many boards/modules as possible, but there may be limitations. Adafruit
Feather HUZZAH board is taken as a reference board for the port (for example,
testing is performed on it).
