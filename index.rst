Adafruit MicroPython API Reference
========================================

Welcome! This is the documentation for Adafruit MicroPython. It is an open
source derivative of `MicroPython <https://micropython.org>`_ for use on
educational development boards designed and sold by `Adafruit
<https://adafruit.com>`_ including the `Arduino Zero
<https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardZero>`_, `Adafruit Feather M0 Basic
<https://www.adafruit.com/product/2772>`_, `Adafruit Feather HUZZAH
<https://www.adafruit.com/products/2821>`_ and `Adafruit Feather M0 Bluefruit LE
<https://www.adafruit.com/products/2995>`_.

Adafruit's MicroPython port features a unified Python APIs available under
`shared-bindings` and a growing list of drivers that work with it. Currently
only the Atmel SAMD21 port is supported but ESP8266 support will be added in the
near future.

`Adafruit <https://adafruit.com>`_ has many excellent tutorials available
through the `Adafruit Learning System <https://learn.adafruit.com/>`_. These
docs are low-level API docs and may link out to separate getting started guides.
