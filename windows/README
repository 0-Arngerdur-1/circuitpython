This is experimental, community-supported Windows port of MicroPython.
It is based on Unix port, and expected to remain so.

To cross-compile under Debian/Ubuntu Linux system:

sudo apt-get install mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime
make CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc

The port requires additional testing, debugging, and patches. Please
